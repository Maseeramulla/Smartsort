- Designed an automated system for waste classification, with a focus on segregating coloured glass to enhance recycling processes.  
- Compiled a dataset of 5,000 images divided into nine categories (e.g., glass, metal, plastic) using data from existing waste datasets.  
- Developed and trained two CNN models—a custom-built model and a hybrid DenseNet201 pre-trained model—to classify various waste types.  
- Achieved a remarkable 92% accuracy, exceeding current methods and offering significant advancements in waste management efficiency.
